\
The immune system is an interacting set of specialised cells and proteins designed to identify and destroy harmful foreign inaders before they can damage the body.

Q1. What are immunological disorders caused by?
\
Immunological disorders are diseases or conditions caused by a dysfunction of the immune system and include allergies, asthma, autoimmune disorders, autoinflammatory syndromes, immunodeficiency syndromes.

=== History of Immunology

Immunology started with variolation in ancient China, where dried
crusts derived from smallpox pustules were either inhaled or
inserted into small cuts in the skin (a technique called vari-
olation) in order to prevent smallpox, and was then followed by Jenner's work on vaccination.
\
Pasteur hypothesized and later showed that aging had weak-
ened the virulence of the pathogen and that such a weakened
or attenuated strain could be administered to provide immu-
nity against the disease. He called this attenuated strain a
vaccine (from the Latin vacca, meaning “cow”), in honor of
Jenner’s work with cowpox inoculation.
\
One consequence of eradication
is that universal vaccination becomes unnecessary. This is a
tremendous benefit, as most vaccines carry at least a slight
risk to persons vaccinated. And yet in many cases every
individual does not need to be immune in order to protect
most of the population. As a critical mass of people acquire
protective immunity, either through vaccination or infection,
they can serve as a buffer for the rest. This principle, called
herd immunity, works by decreasing the number of indi-
viduals who can harbor and spread an infectious agent, sig-
nificantly decreasing the chances that susceptible individuals
will become infected.

Pasteur showed that vaccination worked, but he did not
understand how. Some scientists believed that immune pro-
tection in vaccinated individuals was mediated by cells, while
others postulated that a soluble agent delivered protection.

=== Humoral vs Cellular theories

Von Behring demonstrated that the passive administration of serum containing antitoxin from animal suffering with diphtheria protected uninfected animal from infection.
An important result that came out of the experiment was that the factor responsible for protection present in the serum is specific - serum from an animalk exposed to a different strain was not useful.

\
Elie Metchnikoff, another
Nobel Prize winner, demonstrated that cells also contribute
to the immune state of an animal. He observed that certain
white blood cells, which he termed phagocytes, ingested
(phagocytosed) microorganisms and other foreign mate-
rial . Noting that these phagocytic cells
were more active in animals that had been immunized,
Metchnikoff hypothesized that cells, rather than serum
components, were the major effectors of immunity. The
active phagocytic cells identified by Metchnikoff were
likely blood monocytes and neutrophils.

=== Innate Immune system

+ non-specific
+ first line of defense
+ no memory

Components:

+ Physical - skin, mucociliary escalator, flushing action of saliva, tears, urine
+ Biochemical - normal flora that may screte antimicrobial peptides, and compete for resources, HCl in stomach, lysozyme in tears/saliva
+ cells
