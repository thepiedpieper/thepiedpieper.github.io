Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which provide a particularly ordered lipid environment. 
Certain specialised regions of the membrane, such as the caveolae involved in endocytosis are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, and because the hydrocarbon chains of the sphingolipids are straighter and longer than those of the other membrane lipids, raft domains are thicker and can better accommodate certain membrane proteins.
\
Thus the lateral segregation f proteins and lipids into raft domains would, in process, be mutually stabilising.
