#align(center)[= Day 2 (Adaptive Immunity)]

\
Adaptive immunity comes into play when the innate immunity of our body fails. Adaptive immunity or specific immunity, is capable of recognizing and selectively removing specific foreign antigen or microorganism.
\
THe following are the features of adaptive immunity:
+ Specificity
+ Specialisation
+ Recognition of self from non-self
+ Slow and only develops after antigen exposure
+ Memory
+ Self-limitation 

Adaptive immunity is of two types:
- humoral immunity
- cell-mediated Immunity

\
First we shall be looking at the main players of adaptive immunity.
+ *T cells* - responsible for cellular immunity
+ *B cells* - responsible for humoral Immunity

=== Antigenic Specificity

It was found that injecting an animal with almost any nonself organic chemical could induce production of antibodies that would bind specifically to that chemical. In fact, antibodies have an almost unlimited range of reactivity, uincluding responses to compounds that have only been recently synthesised in the laboratory and not found in nature. These antibodies can differentiate between molecules differing even in a single amino acid - and in order to explain this specificity, two theories were proposed :
+ selective theory 
+ instructional theory

==== Selective theory

Ehrlich proposed that binding
of the receptor to an infectious agent was like the fit
between a lock and key. Ehrlich suggested that interaction
between an infectious agent and a cell-bound receptor
would induce the cell to produce and release more recep-
tors with the same specificity (Figure 1-4). In Ehrlich’s
mind, the cells were pluripotent, expressing a number of
different receptors, each of which could be individually
“selected.” According to Ehrlich’s theory, the specificity of
the receptor was determined in the host before its expo-
sure to the foreign antigen, and therefore the antigen
selected the appropriate receptor. Later it was found that each cell produces many copies of the receptors in soluble form, now called antibodies, once it has been selected by antigen binding.

This ultimately gave rise to the *clonal selection theory*, according to which, an individual B or T cell expresses many copes of a membrane receptor that is distinct for a single antigen. The unique recepetor specificity is determined in the lymphocyte before exposure to the antigen. Binding of the antigen to the specific receptor activates the cell, causing it to proliferate into a clone of daughter cells that have the same receptor specificity as the parent cell.

The array of antigenic specificities of lymphocytes that exist at
any given moment of time is tremendous (approximately one
billion or more).
 This enormous diversity of specificities exists independently of
exposure to antigens, and is being created by molecular
mechanisms intrinsic to T and B lymphocytes.

an indiviual called the lymphocyte repertoire.

=== Pathogen recognition molecules

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (or PAMPs) are
common foreign structures that characterize whole groups of
pathogens. It is these unique antigenic structures that the
immune system frequently recognizes first.
White blood cells naturally
express a variety of receptors, collectively referred to as pat-
tern recognition receptors (PRRs), that specifically recognize
these sugar residues, as well as other common foreign structures. When PRRs detect these chemical structures, a cascade
of events labels the target pathogen for destruction. PPRs are
proteins encoded in the genomic DNA and are always
expressed by many different immune cells. These conserved,
germline-encoded recognition molecules are thus a first line of
defense for the quick detection of many of the typical chemi-
cal identifiers carried by the most common invaders. A significant and powerful corollary to this is that it allows
early categorizing or profiling of the sort of pathogen of con-
cern. This is key to the subsequent immune response routes
that will be followed, and therefore the fine tailoring of the
immune response as it develops.
\


How can our
DNA encode a recognition system for things that change in
random ways over time? Better yet, how do we build a system to
recognize new chemical structures that may arise in the future?
\
Thankfully, the vertebrate immune system has evolved a
clever, albeit resource intensive, response to this dilemma: to
favor randomness in the design of some recognition mole-
cules. This strategy, called generation of diversity, is
employed only by developing B and T lymphocytes. The result
is a group of B and T cells where each expresses many copies of
one unique recognition molecule, resulting in a population
with the theoretical potential to respond to any antigen that
may come along (Figure 1-7). This feat is accomplished by
rearranging and editing the genomic DNA that encodes the
antigen receptors expressed by each B or T lymphocyte. Not
unlike the error-prone DNA replication method employed by
pathogens, this system allows chance to play a role in generat-
ing a menu of responding recognition molecules. This process is not without risk - it takes place in the primary lymphoid organs, and cells have to survive the quality control processes that follow. \
Surviving cells
move into the circulation of the body, where they are available
if their specific, or cognate, antigen is encountered. When
antigens bind to the surface receptors on these cells, they trigger clonal selection.

=== Diversity

The diversity of antibodies is created by the combination of variable regions of H chains and L chains.
It is reported that there are 10,530 types of H-chains and 200 types of L-chains, which make as many as 2,106,000 different types. Furthermore, because there are other mechanisms for producing diversity such as mutations, it is possible to produce antibodies that can bind to virtually any antigen.
The diversity of antibodies is determined by a mechanism called gene restructuring.

The genes in the heavy chain variable region of an antibody are divided into VH gene regions, DH gene regions, and JH gene regions. Also, the gene in the light chain variable region of antibodies is divided into the VL gene region and JL gene region. These gene regions are assembled by selecting one type from multiple gene fragments.

In this way, a variety of antibodies are assembled by gene fragments from the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region.



    Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies, a result of variation in amino acid composition that allows them to interact with many different antigens.
    Antibodies obtain their diversity through 2 processes. The first is called V(D)J (variable, diverse, and joining regions) recombination. During cell maturation, the B cell splices out the DNA of all but one of the genes from each region and combine the three remaining genes to form one VDJ segment.
    The second stage of recombination occurs after the B cell is activated by an antigen.In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation.
    As a consequence of these processes any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody’s antigen-binding affinity.
    Point mutations can result in the production of antibodies that have a lower or higher affinity with their antigen than the original antibody. \
    B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities (called *affinity maturation*).



=== Tolerance of Self-Antigen

In order for the immune system to work effectively, it must avoid accidentally recognizing and destroying host tissues - a process called *tolerance*. \

To establish tolerance, the antigen receptors present on
developing B and T cells must first pass a test of nonrespon-
siveness against host structures. This process, which begins
shortly after these randomly generated receptors are pro-
duced, is achieved by the destruction or inhibition of any
cells that have inadvertently generated receptors with the
ability to harm the host.

=== Memory

One particularly significant and unique attribute of the
adaptive arm of the immune response is immunologic memory. This is the ability of the immune system to respond
much more swiftly and with greater efficiency during a sec-
ond exposure to the same pathogen. During a first
encounter with foreign antigen, adaptive immunity under-
goes what is termed a primary response, during which the
key lymphocytes that will be used to eradicate the pathogen
are clonally selected, honed, and enlisted to resolve the
infection. All subsequent encounters with the same antigen or patho-
gen are referred to as the secondary response. During a secondary response, memory cells, kin of the final
and most efficient B and T lymphocytes trained during the
primary response, are re-enlisted to fight again. These cells
begin almost immediately and pick up right where they left
off, continuing to learn and improve their eradication strategy
during each subsequent encounter with the same antigen.
