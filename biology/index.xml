        <description>The Sex Peptide in Drosophila melanogaster melSP is a component of the seminal fluid that induces post mating responses in Drosophila females. It is gradually released by proteolytic cleavage and induces several long-term postmating responses What does this entail? SP acts on internal sensory neurons expressing pickpocket(ppk). These then induce PMR.
Classic Post Mating responses elevated egg-laying
reluctance to further mating
altered dietary preference(high protein:carbohydrate interference) - (testing nutrient deficient flies by activating this group of neurons?</description>

        <description>What is migration? The conversion of stationary epithelial cells into migratory, invasive cells, which is important for normal embryonic development. How do cells achieve this? Cells that are part of a stable epithelium lose their cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions that hold them together and acquire a less rigidly polarised morphology and break away from their neighbours.
Forward genetic analysis This involves uncovering the genetic basis behind a particular phenotype. Mutant lines are screened for specific defects in the process of interest.</description>

        <description>Living in a college on the outskirts of acres of farmland and dense shrubbery might be a bit boring, but it has its perks. I came across this one in front of my room.
The Indian Common Clubtail dragonfly, Ictinogomphus rapax, is found all over India. It&amp;rsquo;s a large yellow and black coloured dragonfly with bluish-grey ommatidia.
The name refers to the club-like widening of the end of the abdomen (abdominal segments 7 through 9).</description>
