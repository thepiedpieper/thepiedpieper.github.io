        <description>The Sex Peptide in Drosophila melanogaster melSP is a component of the seminal fluid that induces post mating responses in Drosophila females. It is gradually released by proteolytic cleavage and induces several long-term postmating responses What does this entail? SP acts on internal sensory neurons expressing pickpocket(ppk). These then induce PMR.
Classic Post Mating responses elevated egg-laying
reluctance to further mating
altered dietary preference(high protein:carbohydrate interference) - (testing nutrient deficient flies by activating this group of neurons?</description>

        <description>What is migration? The conversion of stationary epithelial cells into migratory, invasive cells, which is important for normal embryonic development. How do cells achieve this? Cells that are part of a stable epithelium lose their cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions that hold them together and acquire a less rigidly polarised morphology and break away from their neighbours.
Forward genetic analysis This involves uncovering the genetic basis behind a particular phenotype. Mutant lines are screened for specific defects in the process of interest.</description>

        <description>deals with degree of localisation in brain
explanaing behaviour as properties of specific nerve cells and interconnections in particular regions of brain
Talks about how neurons are different because of polarisation, excitability, and molecules they produce, along with compartmentalisation which helps in effective and quick conduction of signals
Neurons similar to epithelial cells neurons develop from epithelium basolateral surface â€’ cyton part with dendrite &amp;amp; apical surface - part from which axon arises plasmalemma with asymmetric bilayer, same cytosolic housekeeping proteins; extra is some special ones, like ones used to degrade neurotransmitters Selective distribution of organelles and molecules throughout cell Vesicular pathways - exocytic (membrane proteins secreted by RER - Golgi incorporated into plasmalemma, secretory pathway) &amp;amp; endocytic (membrane taken in from plasmalemma shuttled back by vesicular recycling, or taken to lysosomes for degradation by endosomes) Shape of neuron determined by cytoskeleton cytoskeleton - microtubules, neuronal filaments, actin microtubules - made of tubulin (GTPase); poylmerisation happens due to binding of GTP bound tubulin dimers.</description>
