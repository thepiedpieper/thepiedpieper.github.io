        <description>Subject - The Plains Cupid (Luthrodes pandava)
Long afternoon walks are the best thing to happen to raccoon-eyed college students who have taken to living in the library.

These butterflies belong to the Lycaenidae family (tribe Polyommatini) of butterflies, (the second-largest family of butterflies behind Nymphalidae, or the brush footed butterflies), whose members are called gossamer-winged butterflies.</description>
