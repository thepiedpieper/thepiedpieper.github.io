        <description>deals with degree of localisation in brain
explanaing behaviour as properties of specific nerve cells and interconnections in particular regions of brain
Talks about how neurons are different because of polarisation, excitability, and molecules they produce, along with compartmentalisation which helps in effective and quick conduction of signals
Neurons similar to epithelial cells neurons develop from epithelium basolateral surface â€’ cyton part with dendrite &amp;amp; apical surface - part from which axon arises plasmalemma with asymmetric bilayer, same cytosolic housekeeping proteins; extra is some special ones, like ones used to degrade neurotransmitters Selective distribution of organelles and molecules throughout cell Vesicular pathways - exocytic (membrane proteins secreted by RER - Golgi incorporated into plasmalemma, secretory pathway) &amp;amp; endocytic (membrane taken in from plasmalemma shuttled back by vesicular recycling, or taken to lysosomes for degradation by endosomes) Shape of neuron determined by cytoskeleton cytoskeleton - microtubules, neuronal filaments, actin microtubules - made of tubulin (GTPase); poylmerisation happens due to binding of GTP bound tubulin dimers.</description>

        <description>Synthesis and Transport of Neuronal Protein Protein Synthesis in the Cell Body mostly in cell body and dendrite beginnings different sequences in N-terminal or inside mark it for different processes, for example, modification, secretion, or say degradation(Ubiquitinylation) chaperons(Hsp70) help in protein folding (energy dependent) Protein Modification changes - cotranslational/ posttranslational permanent/transient N-acylation (Myristoylation) - addition of lipid chain to acylated N-terminus(Gly) allow it to associate with membrane through chain Thioacylation - allow protein to associate with cytosolic leaflet of membrane (e.</description>
