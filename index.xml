        <description>The Black Headed Ibis The Black Headed Ibis (Threskiornins melanocephalus), also known as the Oriental white ibis, is a large wader found over a large range of South-eastern Asia. It is a large Ciconiiform (order comprising storklike birds) with adults measuring 65-70cm.
It is the only native ibis species in its range that has an overall white plumage with a black neck and head. The down-curved beak and legs are also black</description>

        <description>Subject - The Plains Cupid (Luthrodes pandava)
Long afternoon walks are the best thing to happen to raccoon-eyed college students who have taken to living in the library. Especially if you are intercepted by these pretty sights; they flit about in the bushes, and dance nimbly on the slender stalks of coatbuttons, and overall, make a torrid summer more bearable.
A male wet season brood
These butterflies belong to the Lycaenidae family (tribe Polyommatini) of butterflies, (the second-largest family of butterflies behind Nymphalidae, or the brush footed butterflies), whose members are called gossamer-winged butterflies.</description>

        <description>What is migration? The conversion of stationary epithelial cells into migratory, invasive cells, which is important for normal embryonic development. How do cells achieve this? Cells that are part of a stable epithelium lose their cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions that hold them together and acquire a less rigidly polarised morphology and break away from their neighbours.
Forward genetic analysis This involves uncovering the genetic basis behind a particular phenotype. Mutant lines are screened for specific defects in the process of interest.</description>

        <description>deals with degree of localisation in brain
explanaing behaviour as properties of specific nerve cells and interconnections in particular regions of brain
Talks about how neurons are different because of polarisation, excitability, and molecules they produce, along with compartmentalisation which helps in effective and quick conduction of signals
Neurons similar to epithelial cells neurons develop from epithelium basolateral surface â€’ cyton part with dendrite &amp;amp; apical surface - part from which axon arises plasmalemma with asymmetric bilayer, same cytosolic housekeeping proteins; extra is some special ones, like ones used to degrade neurotransmitters Selective distribution of organelles and molecules throughout cell Vesicular pathways - exocytic (membrane proteins secreted by RER - Golgi incorporated into plasmalemma, secretory pathway) &amp;amp; endocytic (membrane taken in from plasmalemma shuttled back by vesicular recycling, or taken to lysosomes for degradation by endosomes) Shape of neuron determined by cytoskeleton cytoskeleton - microtubules, neuronal filaments, actin microtubules - made of tubulin (GTPase); poylmerisation happens due to binding of GTP bound tubulin dimers.</description>
