        <description>The Streaked Spiderhunter If you are ever out birding in montane forests in eastern India, and if you are lucky enough to see scores of small birds flitting about in the trees on dainty wings, you can always spot these birds out by their obscenely long beaks.
There are eleven species of spiderhunters in South and Southeastern Asia, and this is one of the two found in India.
Spiderhunters forage all parts of the forest canopy, never veering close to the ground; if you stand long enough, they appear almost squirrel-like as they scuttle and look for small invertebrates.</description>

        <description>The Sex Peptide in Drosophila melanogaster melSP is a component of the seminal fluid that induces post mating responses in Drosophila females. It is gradually released by proteolytic cleavage and induces several long-term postmating responses What does this entail? SP acts on internal sensory neurons expressing pickpocket(ppk). These then induce PMR.
Classic Post Mating responses elevated egg-laying
reluctance to further mating
altered dietary preference(high protein:carbohydrate interference) - (testing nutrient deficient flies by activating this group of neurons?</description>

        <description>The Black Headed Ibis (Threskiornins melanocephalus), also known as the Oriental white ibis, is a large wader found over a large range of South-eastern Asia. It is a large Ciconiiform (order comprising storklike birds) with adults measuring 65-70cm.
It is the only native ibis species in its range that has an overall white plumage with a black neck and head. The down-curved beak and legs are also black.
Introduction
The black headed ibis is a medium, nomadic, wading waterbird, frequently found in association with other Ciconiiforms or pelicaniiforms in shallow waters.</description>

        <description>Subject - The Plains Cupid (Luthrodes pandava)
Long afternoon walks are the best thing to happen to raccoon-eyed college students who have taken to living in the library. Especially if you are intercepted by these pretty sights; they flit about in the bushes, and dance nimbly on the slender stalks of coatbuttons, and overall, make a torrid summer more bearable.
A male wet season brood
These butterflies belong to the Lycaenidae family (tribe Polyommatini) of butterflies, (the second-largest family of butterflies behind Nymphalidae, or the brush footed butterflies), whose members are called gossamer-winged butterflies.</description>

        <description>What is migration? The conversion of stationary epithelial cells into migratory, invasive cells, which is important for normal embryonic development. How do cells achieve this? Cells that are part of a stable epithelium lose their cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions that hold them together and acquire a less rigidly polarised morphology and break away from their neighbours.
Forward genetic analysis This involves uncovering the genetic basis behind a particular phenotype. Mutant lines are screened for specific defects in the process of interest.</description>

        <description>DNA Watson and Crick&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis had immediately suggested a possible self-replication method for DNA because of complementarity in base pairing.
At this junction, possible modes of DNA replication: Conservative / Semi-conservative / Dispersive
Meselson-Stahl Experiment proves replication is semi-conservative Bacteria grown in N(15) medium incorporate N14 in a light medium - CsCl density gradient centrifugation revealed.
Identification of Replication Fork John Cairns identified the replication fork by allowing replicating DNA in cells to incorporate tritiated thymidine.</description>

        <description>Living in a college on the outskirts of acres of farmland and dense shrubbery might be a bit boring, but it has its perks. I came across this one in front of my room.
The Indian Common Clubtail dragonfly, Ictinogomphus rapax, is found all over India. It&amp;rsquo;s a large yellow and black coloured dragonfly with bluish-grey ommatidia.
The name refers to the club-like widening of the end of the abdomen (abdominal segments 7 through 9).</description>

        <title>The Presocratic Philosophers - Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes</title>

        <description>Our information about Plato&amp;rsquo;s predecessors in philosophy, who we call Presocratic philosophers, is limited by the vast abyss between our worlds - the Holy Roman empire took down with it a large share of the literature and the material culture of its age. As the rest of the West succumbed to Christian powers, imitations of surviving literature by monks were all that remained of antique philosphy. They are most of what we have today from that age.</description>
