        <description>Our information about Plato&amp;rsquo;s predecessors in philosophy, who we call Presocratic philosophers, is limited by the vast abyss between our worlds - the Holy Roman empire took down with it a large share of the literature and the material culture of its age. As the rest of the West succumbed to Christian powers, imitations of surviving literature by monks were all that remained of antique philosphy. They are most of what we have today from that age.</description>
